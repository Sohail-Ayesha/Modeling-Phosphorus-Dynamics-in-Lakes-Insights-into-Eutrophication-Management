Modeling Phosphorus Dynamics in Lakes: Insights into Eutrophication Management
he code explores the relationship between phosphorus concentration and external nutrient inputs, offering insights into equilibrium points and stability. By simulating different scenarios, we can better understand eutrophicationâ€”an important issue for lake management. This work is inspired by the foundational research of Carpenter, S.R., Ludwig, D., and Brock, W.A. (1999) on managing lakes facing potentially irreversible changes.
